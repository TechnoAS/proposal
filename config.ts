        body: `From the very first moment you came into my life, everything changed — the colors got brighter, the days got warmer, and my heart found its home in you.

You are the first thought that wakes me up and the last smile before I fall asleep. Every laugh we share, every silly moment, every quiet second together — I hold them all so close to my heart.

I love the way your eyes light up when you're happy, the sound of your voice that makes everything feel okay, and the way you love so deeply without even trying. You make my messy world feel beautiful, Risha.

I don't need a special day to tell you this, but today I want to shout it — I am so incredibly lucky to have you. You are not just my love, you are my best friend, my safe place, and my forever.

I promise to love you a little more with every passing day, to hold your hand through every storm, and to never stop making you smile. 💕`,
